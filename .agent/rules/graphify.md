# MANDATORY: Query graphify before any file tool
Before calling grep_search, view_file, read_file, or list_dir,
ALWAYS call mcp_graphify_query_graph first. Always. No exceptions.

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- If the graphify MCP server is active, utilize tools like `query_graph`, `get_node`, and `shortest_path` for precise architecture navigation instead of falling back to `grep`
- After modifying code files in this session, run `python3 -c "from graphify.watch import _rebuild_code; from pathlib import Path; _rebuild_code(Path('.'))"` to keep the graph current
